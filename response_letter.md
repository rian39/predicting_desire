Dear Editors,

I have addressed the readers' and your own comments in a quite substantive revision of the manuscript. There are too many changes to list here. The tracked changes version of the manuscript shows them in detail. Note that many of these changes are not sentence level, but reorganisations of the manuscript. 

In the revisions, I responded to many of the referees comments and your suggestions. I had some quibbles with one of the reports, but addressed those in passing (for instance, I responded to complaints about use of the term 'generic' by removing them). More importantly, I have backed away from some of the claims about 'desire.' That was a bit of a red herring, since the manuscript never sought to rely on or develop an account of the prediction of desire or the desire to predict. (Desire stood in there mainly as a kind of limit case, or horizon for the generalization of prediction.) I hope this change makes sense. The core focus of the article now rests more clearly on the ways in which prediction is being generalized or expanded through machine learning. The goal in providing an account of this process of mobilization or expansion is to begin to develop ways of talking about it that allow both critique (I do some of this in the section on problematization) and evaluation of inventive responses to prediction. In your own suggestions, you asked for me on this latter point. I couldn't do that because I think these inventive responses to prediction have barely begun to take shape. 

yours

Adrian Mackenzie
