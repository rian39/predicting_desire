J	Baecke, P; Van den Poel, D				Baecke, Philippe; Van den Poel, Dirk			Improving customer acquisition models by incorporating spatial autocorrelation at different levels of granularity	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Customer relationship management (CRM); Predictive analytics; Customer intelligence; Marketing; Data augmentation; Autoregressive model; Automobile industry	WORD-OF-MOUTH; AUTOLOGISTIC REGRESSION-MODEL; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS; PRODUCT; VARIABLES; BEHAVIOR	Traditional CRM models often ignore the correlation that could exist among the purchasing behavior of surrounding prospects. Hence, a generalized linear autologistic regression model can be used to capture this interdependence and improve the predictive performance of the model. In particular, customer acquisition models can benefit from this. These models often suffer from a lack of data quality due to the limited amount of information available about potential new customers. Based on a customer acquisition model of a Japanese automobile brand, this study shows that the extra value resulting from incorporating neighborhood effects can vary significantly depending on the granularity level on which the neighborhoods are composed. A model based on a granularity level that is too coarse or too fine will incorporate too much or too little interdependence resulting in a less than optimal predictive improvement. Since neighborhood effects can have several sources (i.e. social influence, homophily and exogeneous shocks), this study suggests that the autocorrelation can be divided into several parts, each optimally measured at a different level of granularity. Therefore, a model is introduced that simultaneously incorporates multiple levels of granularity resulting in even more accurate predictions. Further, the effect of the sample size is examined. This shows that including spatial interdependence using finer levels of granularity is only useful when enough data is available to construct stable spatial lag effects. As a result, extending a spatial model with multiple granularity levels becomes increasingly valuable when the data sample becomes larger.

Data Science, Predictive Analytics, and Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform Supply Chain Design and Management	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS			English	Article						data science; predictive analytics; big data; logistics; supply chain management; design; collaboration; integration; education		We illuminate the myriad of opportunities for research where supply chain management (SCM) intersects with data science, predictive analytics, and big data, collectively referred to as DPB. We show that these terms are not only becoming popular but are also relevant to supply chain research and education. Data science requires both domain knowledge and a broad set of quantitative skills, but there is a dearth of literature on the topic and many questions. We call for research on skills that are needed by SCM data scientists and discuss how such skills and domain knowledge affect the effectiveness of an SCM data scientist. Such knowledge is crucial to develop future supply chain leaders. We propose definitions of data science and predictive analytics as applied to SCM. We examine possible applications of DPB in practice and provide examples of research questions from these applications, as well as examples of research questions employing DPB that stem from management theories. Finally, we propose specific steps interested researchers can take to respond to our call for research on the intersection of SCM and DPB.

J	Ismail, FA; Aris, AZ				Ismail, Farhah Amalya; Aris, Ahmad Zaharin			Experimental determination of Cd2+ adsorption mechanism on low-cost biological waste	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						carbonate shell; cadmium; heavy metal; adsorption mechanism; saturation state	HEAVY-METALS; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; MOLLUSK SHELLS; REMOVAL; WATER; BIOSORPTION; ARAGONITE; CADMIUM; CHITOSAN; SORPTION	Carbonate shells have an astonishing ability in the removal of Cd2+ in a short time period with emphasis on being a low cost adsorbent. In the present study, the sorption capacity of carbonate shells was studied for Cd2+ in batch experiments. The influence of different carbonate shell sizes and physico-chemical factors were evaluated and the results were analyzed for its correlation matrices by using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW). The mineralogy state of aqueous solution regarding the saturation index was simulated using PHREEQC to identify the Cd2+ uptake mechanism. The Cd uptake rates were calculated as well as Ca2+, HCO (3) (-) concentration, pH, ambient humidity and temperature were measured. Cd2+ removal of 91.52% was achieved after 5 h adsorption. The adsorption efficiencies were significantly influenced by pH as they increased with the increase of pH from acidic solution (5.50 +/- 0.02) to slightly alkaline (7.60 +/- 0.05). In addition, the mineralogy state of aqueous solution calculated from PHREEQC confirmed that the increment of Ca2+ and HCO (3) (-) concentrations in solution was attributed to the dissolution of carbonate shells. Moreover, the ion exchange adsorption mechanism of Cd2+ toward Ca2+ was identified as the process involved in Cd2+ uptake.

J	D'Haen, J; Van den Poel, D; Thorleuchter, D				D'Haen, Jeroen; Van den Poel, Dirk; Thorleuchter, Dirk			Predicting customer profitability during acquisition: Finding the optimal combination of data source and data mining technique	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Marketing analytics; Predictive analytics; Data source; B2B; Web mining; Web crawling; Bagging; Profitability; Customer acquisition; External commercial data	OPERATIONAL-RESEARCH; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SELECTION; CHURN; MODEL	The customer acquisition process is generally a stressful undertaking for sales representatives. Luckily there are models that assist them in selecting the 'right' leads to pursue. Two factors play a role in this process: the probability of converting into a customer and the profitability once the lead is in fact a customer. This paper focuses on the latter. It makes two main contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, it investigates the predictive performance of two types of data: web data and commercially available data. The aim is to find out which of these two have the highest accuracy as input predictor for profitability and to research if they improve accuracy even more when combined. Secondly, the predictive performance of different data mining techniques is investigated. Results show that bagged decision trees are consistently higher in accuracy. Web data is better in predicting profitability than commercial data, but combining both is even better. The added value of commercial data is, although statistically significant, fairly limited.

Objective: This article presents data covering 10 years of MoH/AVSI PMTCT program activities in Northern Uganda. Methods: The program followed Uganda MoH PMTCT guidelines and aimed to be comprehensive, emphasizing social and medical care and support. Data were collected from 24 health facilities from January 2002 to December 2011. Trend analyses were carried out using Predictive Analytics SoftWare (PASW) Statistics 18. Results: Of the 140,658 women who newly attended antenatal care services from 2002 to 2011, 94.4% received HIV testing and counseling and 6.2% tested HIV-positive. HIV testing and counseling of male partners of tested pregnant women steadily increased from 5.9% in 2002 to 75.8% in 2011, compared with 15.5% in 2011 nationally. Overall, 79.0% of HIV-positive women were started on antiretroviral prophylaxis (69.4%) or triple antiretroviral therapy (9.6%), compared with 52% nationally in 2011. The proportion of HIV-positive women who delivered in health facilities significantly increased from 55.8% in 2004 to 81.1% in 2011 (no national data available). HIV prevalence among HIV-exposed infants tested at or below 18 months of age significantly decreased from 10.3% in 2004 to 5.0% in 2011. Conclusions: Our results show how a comprehensive PMTCT program emphasizing social and community engagement alongside medical care and support can succeed in a remote setting with multiple challenges.

Study Design: Comparative study. Place and Duration of Study: Karwan-e-Hayat, Psychiatric Care and Rehabilitation Centre, Keamari, Karachi, Pakistan, from January to August 2011. Methodology: To test our hypotheses, 69 participants were selected from Karwan-e-Hayat Psychiatric Care and Rehabilitation Centre, Karachi on the basis of purposive sampling technique and 79 from Karachi city on the basis of convenient sampling technique. To measure their perceived paternal acceptance-rejection during childhood, Adult Parental acceptance-rejection questionnaire (PARQ)/control: father-short form (Urdu translation) was administered. The statistical analysis of data was done with the predictive analytics software (PASW). Results: One hundred and forty eight (78 males and 70 females) participants with mean age of 31.28 +/- 9.54 years were included. Out of them 69 (40 males and 29 females) were clinical cases of depression, mania and psychosis with mean age of 33.26 +/- 9.51 years. Seventy nine (38 males and 41 females) were normal individuals with mean age of 29.54 +/- 9.29 years of the demographics corresponding to the clinical population. Independent t-test revealed a significant difference in perceived childhood father acceptance-rejection between clinical and non-clinical population (p < 0.05) and significant gender difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The studied clinical population and male participants perceived to be more rejected by their father during their childhood than non-clinical population and female participants.

A patent citing another implies that the cited patent reflects a piece of previously existing knowledge that the citing patent builds upon. A methodology presented here (1) identifies actual clusters of patents: i.e., technological branches, and (2) gives predictions about the temporal changes of the structure of the clusters. A predictor, called the citation vector, is defined for characterizing technological development to show how a patent cited by other patents belongs to various industrial fields. The clustering technique adopted is able to detect the new emerging recombinations, and predicts emerging new technology clusters. The predictive ability of our new method is illustrated on the example of USPTO subcategory 11, Agriculture, Food, Textiles. A cluster of patents is determined based on citation data up to 1991, which shows significant overlap of the class 442 formed at the beginning of 1997. These new tools of predictive analytics could support policy decision making processes in science and technology, and help formulate recommendations for action.

J	Thomas, C				Thomas, Ciza			Improving intrusion detection for imbalanced network traffic	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						intrusion detection systems; data-dependent decision fusion; precision; recall; F-score; sensor fusion; neural network		The acceptability and usability of intrusion detection systems get seriously affected with data imbalance in network traffic. A large number of false alarms mean a lot in terms of the acceptability of intrusion detection systems. The reason for the increase in false alerts is that the normal traffic abound. Even with highly accurate intrusion detection systems, the effective detection rate of the minority attack types will be unacceptably low, and those attack types are often the most serious ones. Thus, high accuracy is not necessarily an indicator of high model quality, and therein lays the accuracy paradox of predictive analytics. The cost of missing an attack is higher than the cost of false alarms. The aim of this work is to provide an architecture that enables available intrusion detection systems to work together towards creating a more realistic model of the state of a network. The data-dependent decision fusion architecture presented in this paper learns from the data and then appropriately gives weighting to the decisions of various intrusion detection systems. The fusion enriches these weighted decisions to provide a single decision, which is better than those of the existing intrusion detection systems. It is also shown that our technique is more flexible and also outperforms other existing fusion techniques such as OR, AND, SVM, and ANN. This method reduces the false positive rate and improves the overall detection rate and, also, the detection rate of minority class types in particular. For illustrative purposes, two different data sets, namely the DARPA 1999 data set as well as the real-time network traffic embedded with attacks, have been used.

J	Nichols, W				Nichols, Wes			Advertising Analytics 2.0 Advertising touch points no longer work in isolation. If your company doesn't analyze how they interact dynamically, it will be left behind	HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW			English	Article								Most marketers think they know how their advertising affects consumer behavior and drives revenue. They correlate sales data with a few dozen discrete variables, and they rely on consumer surveys, focus groups, media-mix models, and online last-click attribution. But to treat advertising touch points as if each works in isolation is to misrepresent the way today's complex combination of marketing efforts influences purchasing outcomes. MarketShare CEO Wes Nichols explains how many big companies are now deploying analytics 2.0, a set of capabilities that can chew through terabytes of data and hundreds of variables in real time to accurately reveal how advertising touch points interact dynamically. The results: 10% to 30% improvements in marketing performance. Firms of various sizes can make the shift to analytics 2.0 by engaging in three broad activities: Attribution: quantifying the contribution of each element of advertising Optimization: using predictive-analytics tools to run scenarios for business planning Allocation: redistributing resources across marketing activities in real time Nichols argues that implementing analytics 2.0 means building the required infrastructure and entwining it in organizational culture, strategy development, and operations. Any company can begin that journey; businesses that don't will be overtaken by those that do.

J	Kridel, D; Dolk, D				Kridel, Don; Dolk, Daniel			Automated self-service modeling: predictive analytics as a service	INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Customer targeting service; Predictive analytics; Service-oriented architecture; Model management; Automated modeling	SYSTEMS	Research into service provision and innovation is becoming progressively more important as automated service-provision via the web matures as a technology. We describe a web-based targeting platform that uses advanced dynamic model building techniques to conduct intelligent reporting and modeling. The impact of the automated targeting services is realized through a knowledge base that drives the development of predictive model(s). The knowledge base is comprised of a rules engine that guides and evaluates the development of an automated model-building process. The template defines the model classifier (e.g., logistic regression, multinomial logit, ordinary least squares, etc.) in concert with rules for data filling and transformations. Additionally, the template also defines which variables to test ("include" rules) and which variables to retain ("keep" rules). The "final" model emerges from the iterative steps undertaken by the rules engine, and is utilized to target, or rank, the best prospects. This automated modeling approach is designed to cost-effectively assist businesses in their targeting activities-independent of the firm's size and targeting needs. We describe how the service has been utilized to provide "targeting services" for a small to medium business direct marketing campaign, and for direct sales-force targeting in a larger firm. Empirical results suggest that the automated modeling approach provides superior "service" in terms of cost and timing compared to more traditional manual service provision.

(i) availability of massive datasets, (ii) distributed cluster computing (iii) advances in non-parametric Bayesian Inference and (iv) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for fast probability calculations and stochastic searches in high dimensions. The paper presents a historical perspective on the seminal breakthrough developments related to probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian Inference leading up to the current state-of-the-art in data science. This is followed by a discussion of challenges in Big Data Analytics and presentation of a method for Automated Bayesian Machine Learning using a recently developed approach called CrossCat. This approach is based on non-parametric Bayesian Inference and efficient use of MCMC numerical algorithms. Under the DARPA XDATA program, SSCI, MIT and the University of Louisville are developing a Predictive Database System which will have an SQL type front-end and CrossCat backend to facilitate the use of sophisticated machine learning methods by non-experts.

The benchmark for the constant failure rate (lambda) of a specific failure mode of an element (e.g., pressure transmitter, microprocessor, valve, etc.) used to implement a safety instrumented function (SIF) is predicted using the failure modes, effects and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) technique supported by a database of constant failure rates and failure mode distributions for the components which comprise the element. This benchmark represents the lambda of that failure mode inherent in the element during its useful life. The lambda for the same failure mode of the element is estimated from field failure data (FFD) and compared to the benchmark. It is not uncommon for the benchmark lambda and estimated lambda to differ considerably. PA provides a procedure for exploring explanations of these differences and assessing the accuracy of the estimated element lambda with respect to the benchmark lambda of the element. PA can often determine the source of that portion of the estimated lambda value not inherent to the element but likely due to random failures of infant mortality, wear out, or initial failures, to systematic failures, or to application or site specific issues. This site specific element lambda is the portion of the estimated lambda the end user needs to address to improve operational reliability and safety. PA can also assess the quality of FFD and can facilitate the discovery of previously unknown element failure modes.

Augmenting Austrian flood management practices through geospatial predictive analytics: a study in Carinthia	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTION; RESOURCES; HAZARDS	The Danube River basin has long been the location of significant flooding problems across central Europe. The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the frequency, duration and intensity of these flood events, unveiling a dire need for enhanced flood management policy and tools in the region. Located in the southern portion of Austria, the state of Carinthia has experienced a significant volume of intense flood impacts over the last decade. Although the Austrian government has acknowledged these issues, their remedial actions have been primarily structural to date. Continued focus on controlling the natural environment through infrastructure while disregarding the need to consider alternative forms of assessing flood exposure will only act as a provisional solution to this inescapable risk. In an attempt to remedy this flaw, this paper highlights the application of geospatial predictive analytics and spatial recovery index as a proxy for community resilience, as well as the cultural challenges associated with the application of foreign models within an Austrian environment.

S	McGregor, C			IEEE	McGregor, Carolyn			A Platform for Real-time Online Health Analytics during Spaceflight	2013 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2013	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			SUPPORT	Monitoring the health and wellbeing of astronauts during spaceflight is an important aspect of any manned mission. To date the monitoring has been based on a sequential set of discontinuous samplings of physiological data to support initial studies on aspects such as weightlessness, and its impact on the cardiovascular system and to perform proactive monitoring for health status. The research performed and the real-time monitoring has been hampered by the lack of a platform to enable a more continuous approach to real-time monitoring. While any spaceflight is monitored heavily by Mission Control, an important requirement within the context of any spaceflight setting and in particular where there are extended periods with a lack of communication with Mission Control, is the ability for the mission to operate in an autonomous manner. This paper presents a platform to enable real-time astronaut monitoring for prognostics and health management within space medicine using online health analytics. The platform is based on extending previous online health analytics research known as the Artemis and Artemis Cloud platforms which have demonstrated their relevance for multi-patient, multi-diagnosis and multi-stream temporal analysis in real-time for clinical management and research within Neonatal Intensive Care. Artemis and Artemis Cloud source data from a range of medical devices capable of transmission of the signal via wired or wireless connectivity and hence are well suited to process real-time data acquired from astronauts. A key benefit of this platform is its ability to monitor their health and wellbeing on board the mission as well as enabling the astronaut's physiological data, and other clinical data, to be sent to the platform components at Mission Control at each stage when that communication is available. As a result, researchers at Mission Control would be able to simulate, deploy and tailor predictive analytics and diagnostics during the same spaceflight for greater medical support.

Multi-factor of cultural values: a confirmatory factor analytic approach	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						Value-based cultures; Citizenship; Consultation; Caring; Trust; Respect; Quality; Value-based total performance excellence model (VBTPEM)	ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE	All organisations is unique and thus practise different cultural values in the context of an organisation. Determination of values that constitute to the organisation is of challenging task. Therefore, this paper expounds the value-based culture that is related to the performance of the organisation based on the literature review and expert's view. This study aimed at testing the psychometric properties of the questionnaire of value-based culture items of performance measurement based on the value-based total performance excellence model. 400 questionnaires were distributed to the selected Institution of Higher Learning (IHL) i.e, the public university of Malaysia. The data collected was analysed using predictive analytics software and analysis of moment structures software, both version 18. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique i.e., the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach was employed to test the 6-factor hypothesized model of the value-based cultures which consisted values of citizenship, consultation, caring, trust, respect and quality. The result suggested that 2 core values i.e., consultation and trust that dominantly explained the university's culture in the selected university from the proposed of 6 core values in the hypothesized model. The findings also paved the way forward for empowering value-based cultures especially at the IHL. However, future research should be conducted to reaffirm this model to represent the values embraced by the universities in Malaysia.	[Ab Hamid, M.

J	Ballings, M; Van den Poel, D				Ballings, Michel; Van den Poel, Dirk			Customer event history for churn prediction: How long is long enough?	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Predictive analytics; Time window; Length of customer event history; Predictive customer churn model; Explanatory period; Independent period	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; PURCHASING BEHAVIOR; SWITCHING BEHAVIOR; RANDOM FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; SEGMENTATION; RETENTION; DEFECTION; VARIABLES	The key question of this study is: How long should customer event history be for customer churn prediction? While most studies in predictive churn modeling aim to improve models by data augmentation or algorithm improvement, this study focuses on a another dimension: time window optimization with respect to predictive performance. This paper first presents a formalization of the time window selection strategy, along with a literature review. Next, using logistic regression, classification trees and bagging in combination with classification trees, this study analyzes the improvement in churn-model performance by extending customer event history from one to sixteen years. The results show that, after the fifth additional year, predictive performance is only marginally increased, meaning that the company in this study can discard 69% of its data with almost no decrease in predictive performance. The practical implication is that analysts can substantially decrease data-related burdens, such as data storage, preparation and analysis. This is particularly valuable in times of big data when decreasing computational complexity is paramount. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the perception of risk may interfere with the food consumption behavior. The objective of this research was to develop a scale to measure consumer perception of the risks involved in consuming raw vegetable salad in full-service restaurants. The following research steps were carried out: item elaboration; content validity; scale purification (item-total correlation, internal consistency and exploratory factor analysis); and construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis). Non-probabilistic samples of consumers were interviewed (a total of 672 individuals) in the city of Campinas, Brazil. Several analyses were carried out using the Predictive Analytics Software 18.0 and LISREL 8.80. The final scale contained 26 items with an adequate content validity index (0.97) and Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.93). The confirmatory factor analysis validates a six risk type factor model: physical, psychological, social, time, financial and performance (chi-square/degrees of freedom = 2.29, root mean square error of approximation - RMSEA = 0.060 and comparative fit index - CFI = 0.98). The scale developed presented satisfactory reliability and validity results and could therefore be employed in further studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study of collective behavior of individuals has implications to business intelligence, predictive analytics, customer relationship management, and examining online collective action as manifested by various flash mobs, the Arab Spring (2011) and other such events. In this article, we introduce a nature-inspired theory to model collective behavior from the observed data on blogs using swarm intelligence, where the goal is to accurately model and predict the future behavior of a large population after observing their interactions during a training phase. Specifically, an ant colony optimization model is trained with behavioral trend from the blog data and is tested over real-world blogs. Promising results were obtained in trend prediction using ant colony based pheromone classier and CHI statistical measure. We provide empirical guidelines for selecting suitable parameters for the model, conclude with interesting observations, and envision future research directions.

Aims To evaluate the PaJR system's impact on care and the experiences of older people with chronic illness, who were at risk of repeat admissions over 12?months. Design Community-based cohort study random assignment into intervention and usual care group, with process and outcome evaluation. Study population Adult and older patients with multiple morbidity, one or more chronic diseases with one or more overnight hospitalizations, and seven or more general practice visits in the past 6?months. Complex intervention PaJR lay care guides/advocates call patients and their caregivers. The care guides summarize their semi-structured conversations about health concerns and well-being. Predictive modelling and rules-based algorithms trigger alerts in relation to online call summaries. Alerts are acted upon according to agreed guidelines. Analysis Descriptive and comparative statistics. Outcomes Impact on unplanned emergency ambulatory care sensitive admissions (ACSC) with an overnight stay; sensitivity of alerts and predictions; rates of care guides-supported activities. Findings Five part-time lay care guides and a care manager monitored 153 intervention patients for 500 person months with 5050 phone calls. The 153 patients in the intervention group were comparable to the 61 controls. The intervention group reported in 50% of calls that their health limited their social activities; and one-third of calls reported immediate health concerns. Predictive analytics were highly sensitive to risk of hospitalization. ACSC admissions were reduced by 50% compared to controls across the sites. Discussion The initial implementation of a complex patient-centred adaptive chronic care model using lay care guides, supported by machine learning, appeared sensitive to risk of hospitalization and capable of stabilizing illness journeys in older patients with multi-morbidity. Conclusion Actions based on alerts produced in this study appeared to significantly reduce hospitalizations. This paves the way for further testing of the model.

J	Choritz, L; Machert, M; Thieme, H				Choritz, Lars; Machert, Maren; Thieme, Hagen			Correlation of Endothelin-1 Concentration in Aqueous Humor with Intraocular Pressure in Primary Open Angle and Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							BOVINE TRABECULAR MESHWORK; CILIARY EPITHELIAL-CELLS; NERVE HEAD ISCHEMIA; OPTIC-NERVE; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; ANTERIOR SEGMENT; RABBIT EYE; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; DAMAGE; CONTRACTION	PURPOSE. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been found in elevated concentrations in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients. Indirect evidence from animal studies suggests that ET-1 might directly influence intraocular pressure (IOP). The aim of this study was to determine whether ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor of cataract and glaucoma patients correlate with IOP. METHODS. Aqueous humor and blood samples from patients with either cataract (control, n = 38), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG, n = 35), or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG, n = 21), without other ocular or systemic disease, were collected during routine cataract surgery or trabeculectomy. ET-1 concentration was determined by an ET-1 ELISA kit. IOP was measured preoperatively by standard Goldmann applanation tonometry. All statistical analysis was performed using commercial predictive analytics software. RESULTS. Both IOP and ET-1 concentration in aqueous humor were significantly increased in POAG (23.4 +/- 6.8 mm Hg, 5.9 +/- 2.9 pg/mL) and PEXG (24.3 +/- 8.8 mm Hg, 7.7 +/- 2.1 pg/mL) compared with control (15.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, 4.3 +/- 2.4 pg/mL). No difference was detected for plasma ET-1 concentrations. IOP and ET-1 in the aqueous humor were significantly correlated (R = 0.394, R-2 = 0.155, P < 0.001), although no correlation was found between IOP and ET-1 in blood plasma or between ET-1 in aqueous humor and ET-1 in plasma. CONCLUSIONS. In this study, a small but highly significant correlation between IOP and the ET-1 concentration in the aqueous humor was found. Although no causative relationship can be deduced from this, ocular ET-1 effects on IOP control may merit further investigation.

A company that is able to identify likely churners in an early stage can take appropriate steps to prevent these potential churners from actually churning and subsequently increase profit. Academics and practitioners are constantly trying to optimize their predictive-analytics models by searching for better predictors. The aim of this study is to investigate if, in addition to the conventional sets of variables (socio-demographics, purchase history, etc.), kinship network based variables improve the predictive power of customer retention models. Results show that the predictive power of the churn model can indeed be improved by adding the social network (SNA-) based variables. Including network structure measures (i.e. degree, betweenness centrality and density) increase predictive accuracy, but contextual network based variables turn out to have the highest impact on discriminating churners from non-churners. For the majority of the latter type of network variables, the importance in the model is even higher than the individual level counterpart variable. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

S.; Falcao e Cunha, Joao			Modeling partial customer churn: On the value of first product-category purchase sequences	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Marketing; Customer relationship management; Churn analysis; Predictive analytics; Sequence analysis; Retailing; Classification; Logistic regression	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; SEQUENTIAL INFORMATION; SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES; RANDOM FORESTS; PREDICTION; LOYALTY; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK	Retaining customers has been considered one of the most critical challenges among those included in Customer Relationship Management (CRM), particularly in the grocery retail sector. In this context, an accurate prediction whether or not a customer will leave the company, i.e. churn prediction, is crucial for companies to conduct effective retention campaigns. This paper proposes to include in partial churn detection models the succession of first products' categories purchased as a proxy of the state of trust and demand maturity of a customer towards a company in grocery retailing. Motivated by the importance of the first impressions and risks experienced recently on the current state of the relationship, we model the first purchase succession in chronological order as well as in reverse order, respectively. Due to the variable relevance of the first customer-company interactions and of the most recent interactions, these two variables are modeled by considering a variable length of the sequence. In this study we use logistic regression as the classification technique. A real sample of approximately 75,000 new customers taken from the data warehouse of a European retail company is used to test the proposed models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and 1%, 5% and 10% percentiles lift are used to assess the performance of the partial-churn prediction models. The empirical results reveal that both proposed models outperform the standard RFM model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Migueis, V. L.; Camanho, A.

Condition monitoring of SSE gas turbines using artificial neural networks	INSIGHT			English	Article								SSE (formerly Scottish & Southern Energy) has been pursuing a path of continuous improvement in asset reliability, performance and productivity. The Equipment Performance Centre of SSE uses predictive analytics to monitor SSE business critical assets. Gas turbines are one of the most versatile prime mover technologies in the fleet. Power generation using gas turbines has become very popular because of the availability of gas and its relatively low emissions. Detecting impending failures on gas turbines reduces the risk of operational disruption, risk to personnel and loss of revenue, and maintains plant integrity. Effective monitoring and diagnosis requires a range of techniques. This paper outlines one of the diagnostic techniques used to detect combustor-related damage by the examination of gas turbine exhaust temperatures. The diagnostics methodology involves the use of an auto-associative neural network (AANN) to detect anomalies when the current condition deviates from normal behaviour. This type of neural network is a novel approach for the detection of combustor-related damages. The AANN was developed in MATLAB. This method has successfully detected several different combustor-related incidents in the SSE gas turbine fleet. Events such as this have the potential to release material into the gas flow path and cause damage to the turbine. The cost of such a failure can be in the region of several million pounds. The technique can also be used to detect anomalies on other gas turbine sections, ie compressor, fuel, cooling and mechanical systems. This paper illustrates how the technique can be applied to monitor any series of industrial gas turbines.

In particular, we show how latent semantic concepts from textual information of existing customers' websites can be used to uncover characteristics of websites of companies that will turn into profitable customers. Hence, the use of predictive analytics will help to identify new potential acquisition targets. Additionally, we show that a regression model based on these concepts is successful in the profitability prediction of new customers. In a case study, the acquisition process of a mail-order company is supported by creating a prioritized list of new customers generated by this approach. It is shown that the density of profitable customers in this list outperforms the density of profitable customers in traditional generated address lists (e.g. from list brokers). From a managerial point of view, this approach supports the identification of new business customers and helps to estimate the future profitability of these customers in a company. Consequently, the customer acquisition process can be targeted more effectively and efficiently. This leads to a competitive advantage for B2B companies and improves the acquisition process that is time- and cost-consuming with traditionally low conversion rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenge for plant manager is to move closer to reliability limits while being confident the risks of any decision are understood. To attain their goals and meet this challenge they are coming to realize that they must have frequent, accurate assessment of equipment operating conditions, and a path to continued innovation-. At a typical plant, making this assessment involves the collection and effective analysis of reams of complex, interrelated production system data, including demand requirements, load, ambient temperature, as well as the dependent equipment data. Wind turbine health and performance data is available from periodic and real-time systems. To obtain the timeliest understanding of equipment health for all the key resources in a large plant or fleet, engineers increasingly turn to real-time, model-based solutions. Real-time systems are capable of creating actionable intelligence from large amounts and diverse sources of current data. They can automatically detect problems and provide the basis for diagnosis and prioritization effectively for many problems, and they can make periodic inspection methods much more efficient. Technology exists to facilitate prediction of when assets will fail, allowing engineers to target maintenance costs more effectively. But, it is critical to select the best predictive analytics for your plant. How do you make that choice correctly? Real-time condition monitoring and analysis tools need to be matched to engineering process capability. Tools are employed at the plant in lean, hectic environments; others are deployed from central monitoring centers charged with concentrating scarce resources to efficiently support plants. Applications must be flexible and simple to implement and use. Choices made in selection of new tools can be very important to future success of plant operations. So, these choices require solid understanding of the problems to be solved and the advantages and trade-offs of potential solutions. This choice of the best Predictive Analytic solution will be discussed in terms of key technology elements and key engineering elements.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND PATTERN VISUALISATION FOR HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						risk assessment; public health indicators; bioassays; behavioural risk factors; self-organising feature maps; infant mortality	STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; INTEGRITY	Multiple interacting stressors in the environment present increasingly complex risks to human health. Too often, however, the data required for traditional risk assessment are either lacking or unavailable at the necessary spatial or temporal scales. In addition, assessment practices and management policies need to move away from single factors approaches in order to accommodate the reality of complex chemical mixtures and environmental stressors. Recent literature suggests that a paradigm shift is under way and points to the need for the development of new techniques both for rapid data collection and flexible risk assessment strategies that can adapt to make use of readily available data. This paper presents a novel method for population-level risk assessment that uses self-organising feature maps (SOM) to generate multivariate clusters cause-of-death and birth outcome metrics, in combination with the use of supervised learning risk-propagation modelling to identify key factors. We apply this method to identify exposure-outcome linkages at the county level for Wisconsin, USA and civil divisions in Dobrogea, Romania, demonstrating its effectiveness in visualising public health risk relationships with behavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking, heavy drinking) and environmental factors (e.g. land cover, nitrates and faecal coliform in drinking water). These risk relationships do not demonstrate cause-effect, but provide guidance for targeted investigations and for risk-management prioritisation.

S	Popov, A			IEEE	Popov, Alexandre			System Health Management and Space Medicine Predictive Diagnostics. Common Concepts and Approaches	2012 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2012	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, Phmsoc, AESS			DISORDERS; ANXIETY	Mission design for future human exploration spaceflight (moon, asteroids and Mars), with their inherent risks and communications delays, requires a shift in space medicine from a telemedicine paradigm to that of medical autonomy. With the absence of real-time medical ground support, clinical decision support technologies for health monitoring and diagnostics may be required to assist the onboard Crew Medical Officer (CMO). This paper introduces a predictive diagnostics concept for space medicine based on an approach which could be common for both biological and technical systems. In discussing the similarities and differences between the two domains, the paper explores potential solutions applicable for health risk assessment and management. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and associated challenges can be represented in different terms. The engineering discipline focuses on the fundamental principles of system failures in attempt to predict when they might fail, and links the principles to system life cycle management. This is referred to as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Since PHM is a maturing discipline the scientific method that underlines all scientific disciplines has not made its way into PHM research [1]. It must be noted also that there is no general agreement in the research community with respect to the PHM terminology (for example, component aging). [1, 2] Like PHM, predictive diagnostics in conventional medicine is in its infant state due to the lack of scientific foundation on disease prediction. Despite of the infancy stage both of the disciplines have much in common. For both, it is important to know what factors determine the occurrence of the failure (disease). In predictive diagnostics, identification of negative trends with particular failure precursors followed by predicting the future health condition (if no preventive measures are taken) is a challenging task. While prognostics is an engineering discipline focused on predicting the time at which a system or a component will no longer perform its intended function [3], predictive diagnostics is built on the powerful foundation of predictive analytics. Unlike prognostics, predictive analytics in space medicine would need to take into account the essential element - the uniqueness of each crew member. It requires the development of a "set of fingerprints" for each individual that would include information on medical history with the individual health baseline, genetic pre-disposition, medical events, operational context, etc. Whereas predictive analytics indicates what is going to fail, predictive diagnostics also indicates both root and contributing causes of, or factors leading to the potential failure, as well as a priority of the impending failure. However, like PHM, the predictive analytics is based on health maintenance, eliminating the "surprise" factor. The paper introduces a concept for space medicine predictive diagnostics based on real-time health monitoring. To leverage the strength from both data-driven and model-based approaches, a hybrid approach was taken. The concept includes a module-based architecture consisting of a space medicine domain knowledgebase, a customizable inference engine supported by a number of "plug-in-play" voting inference sub-engines, and a web-based interface.

High-Level fusion for intelligence applications using Recombinant Cognition Synthesis	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Data fusion; Situation Awareness; Threat Assessment; Predictive analytics; Knowledge discovery	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; INTERVALS	Intelligence applications exploit heterogeneous data using High-Level fusion systems to gain information superiority. Whereas Low-Level fusion systems have well established frameworks. High-Level fusion has not yet achieved the same level of maturity. Most High-Level systems implement specialized algorithms that yield useful results, albeit for a very narrow input space, and are characterized by stove-pipe architectures and a fragmented workflow. Recombinant Cognition Synthesis bridges the implementation gap of existing fusion models by defining a comprehensive framework of semantic, temporal, and geospatial enablers comprising the primitives, functions, and models, which through a recombinant workflow, maximize the data exploitation value-chain. This paper presents a methodology and the underlying architectural components necessary to implement a unified High-Level fusion intelligence application, followed by a case study that demonstrates the resulting improvements in knowledge discovery and predictive accuracy.

The most common technique, a full combinatorial mesh, is robust but scales poorly to the computational demands of complex models with higher dimensional spaces. Such models are routinely found in the modeling and simulation community. To alleviate the computational requirements, I have implemented two parallelized intelligent search and exploration algorithms: one based on adaptive mesh refinement and the other on regression trees. These algorithms were chosen because there is a dual interest in approaches that allow searching a parameter space for optimal values, as well as exploring the overall space in general. Both intelligent algorithms reduce computational costs at some expense to the quality of results, yet the regression tree approach was orders of magnitude faster than the other methodologies.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH	MIS QUARTERLY			English	Article						Prediction; causal explanation; theory building; theory testing; statistical model; data mining; modeling process	ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS; CLASSIFIER TECHNOLOGY; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; USER ACCEPTANCE; MODELS; AUCTIONS; REGRESSION; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; VARIANCE	This research essay highlights the need to integrate predictive analytics into information systems research and shows several concrete ways in which this goal can be accomplished. Predictive analytics include empirical methods (statistical and other) that generate data predictions as well as methods for assessing predictive power. Predictive analytics not only assist in creating practically useful models, they also play an important role alongside explanatory modeling in theory building and theory testing. We describe six roles for predictive analvtics: new theory generation, measurement development, comparison of competing theories, improvement of existing models, relevance assessment, and assessment of the predictability of empirical phenomena. Despite the importance of predictive analytics, we find that they are rare in the empirical IS literature. Extant IS literature relies nearly exclusively on explanatory statistical modeling, where statistical inference is used to test and evaluate the explanatory power of underlying causal models, and predictive power is assumed to follow automatically from the explanatory model. However, explanatory power does not imply predictive power and thus predictive analytics are necessary for assessing predictive power and for building empirical models that predict well. To show that predictive analytics and explanatory statistical modeling are fundamentally disparate, we show that they are different in each step of the modeling process. These differences translate into different final models, so that a pure explanatory statistical model is best tuned for testing causal hypotheses and a pure predictive model is best in terms of predictive power. We convert a well-known explanatory paper on TAM to a predictive context to illustrate these differences and show how predictive analytics can add theoretical and practical value to IS research.

This article describes Norfolk Southern Railway's BI journey, which began in the early 1990s with departmental reporting, evolved into data warehousing and analytic applications, and has resulted in a company that today uses BI to support corporate strategy. We describe how BI at Norfolk Southern evolved over several decades, with the company developing strong BI foundations and an effective enterprise-wide BI capability. We also identify the practices that kept the BI journey "on track." These practices can be used by other IT and business leaders as they plan and develop BI capabilities in their own organizations.

To describe health-related quality of life in diabetes outpatients and investigate the impact of diabetic foot ulcers, by comparing a group of patients with and without diabetic foot ulcers complications. Secondary to study the impact of sociodemographic and clinical variables in the two groups. Design. Cross-sectional study. Methods. The study involved 130 diabetes outpatients and 127 diabetic foot ulcers patients. Health-related quality of life was measured with the generic questionnaire Short Form-36, consisting of eight dimensional scores. All scores were adjusted for differences in age and gender (estimated marginal means). Differences were compared with anova calculations, by the use of Predictive Analytics Software, pasw (version 17.0). Results. This study confirms that health-related quality of life differs significantly between disease subgroups when measured with Short Form-36. Diabetic foot ulcers had a major negative impact on 7/8 subscales on the Short Form-36 compared to the diabetes outpatients group. health-related quality of life decreased with increasing amount of complications and comorbidity in the diabetes outpatients group, with cardiovascular complications being the most pronounced predictor of lower health-related quality of life scores. Conclusion. Patients who have developed diabetic foot ulcers reports much poorer health-related quality of life than compared to diabetes outpatients. Factors linked to the development of late complications were not detected in the diabetic foot ulcers group, such as cardiovascular comorbidity and neuropathy. Relevance to clinical practice. Health-related quality of life measurement in early stages of disease may detect patients at risk of a more serious disease course and who consequently are in need of a more intensive follow-up.

To deal with these two issues, a multi-agent system (MAS) and knowledge management systems (KMS) based process management system is proposed. The proposed system has two goals: to prevent the PD information quality deterioration by active management of analytical processes and to provide a universal access point allowing the simultaneous use of multiple prediction models.

Forecasting Hotspots-A Predictive Analytics Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Predictive analytics; visual analytics; syndromic surveillance	VISUAL-ANALYTICS; VISUALIZATION; SURVEILLANCE; SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION	Current visual analytics systems provide users with the means to explore trends in their data. Linked views and interactive displays provide insight into correlations among people, events, and places in space and time. Analysts search for events of interest through statistical tools linked to visual displays, drill down into the data, and form hypotheses based upon the available information. However, current systems stop short of predicting events. In spatiotemporal data, analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventative measures. Furthermore, analysts would also like to predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we have created a predictive visual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the combination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our modeling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event locations, thereby maintaining a temporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats.

This paper examines BI from a decision-maker's perspective in an IT governance context through a case study of a large Scandinavian financial institution. The key findings indicate that BI is primarily used to inform structured operational decisions and as an instrument for dialogue in unstructured strategic decisions. Our study shows how 'hard facts' provided by BI are used as a foundation for opening a dialogue and as a supporting instrument to make arguments seem more convincing during decision-making discussions. We also found that standard performance reporting is used more for operational decision making, whereas predictive analytics are utilized primarily in strategic decision making. These results can assist managers looking to improve their operational and strategic decision-making processes by indicating the appropriate type of BI for each type of decision.

Instead of treating this correlation as nuisance in the error term, a generalized linear autologistic regression can be used to take these neighborhood effects into account and improve the predictive performance of a customer identification model for a Japanese automobile brand. In addition, this study shows that the level on which neighborhoods are composed has an important influence on the extra value that results from the incorporation of spatial autocorrelation.

Data mining researchers have augmented upon. the quality of association rule discovery for business development by integrating the influential factors like quantity of items sold (weight), profit (utility), for extracting the association patterns. This paper proposes a new model (associative classifier) based on weightage and utility for useful mining of substantial class association rules. In process of predicting the class lables, all attributes do not have same importance. So our framework considers the different frequencies of individual items as their weights and varied significance can be assigned to different attributes as their utilities according to their predicting capability. Initially, the proposed framework uses the CBA-RG algorithm to produce a set of class association rules from a database and as well as exploits the downward closure property of the apriori algorithm. Subsequently, the set of class association rules mined are subjected to weightage and utility constraints like W-gain, U-gain and a combined Utility Weighted Score (UW-Score) is calculated for the mining of class association rules. We purport a theoretical model to innovate new associative classifier that takes vantage of valuable Class association rules based on the UW-Score.

Recent data mining projects, which have been piloted successfully, have developed predictive models to assist in the better targeting of taxpayers for possible non-compliance/ tax evasion, and liquidation. The models aim, for example, to predict the likelihood of a case yielding in the event of an intervention, such as an audit. Evaluation cases have been worked in the field and the hit rate was approximately 75%. In addition, all audits completed by Revenue in the year after the models had been created were assessed using the model probability to yield score, and a significant correlation exists between the expected and actual outcome of the audits. The models are now being developed further, and are in full production in 2011. Critical factors for model success include rigorous statistical analyses, good data quality, software, teamwork, timing, resources and consistent case profiling/ treatments. The models are developed using SAS Enterprise Miner and SAS Enterprise Guide. This work is a good example of the applicability of tools developed for one purpose (e. g. Credit Scoring for Banking and Insurance) having multiple other potential applications. This paper shows how the application of advanced analytics can add value to the work of Tax and Customs authorities, by leveraging existing data in a robust and flexible way to reduce costs by better targeting cases for interventions. Analytics can thus greatly support the business to make better-informed decisions.			dcleary@revenenue.ie					Davenport T.

In this paper, we try to present some aspects regarding predictive analytics and their role in providing a deeper insight of data, in "adding" intelligence to BI applications. After presenting some notions about predictive analytics - what it means and how it differs from terms like data mining or business intelligence itself, we discuss about the process of predictive modeling, about different types of business users and analytical tools that we can integrate in the BI platform of an organization. At the end, we propose a BI cycle that should be extended to cover all the decision making process, including the decision itself, the action generated by it and to provide feedbacks in order to update it accordingly with the changes of business environment - as both as a way and as a mean to a predictive performance management.

These networks can directly lead to nuclear proliferation, as state or non-state actors attempt to identify and acquire nuclear weapons-related expertise, technologies, components, and materials. The ability to characterize and anticipate the key nodes, transit routes, and exchange mechanisms associated with these networks is essential to influence, disrupt, interdict or destroy the function of the networks and their processes. The complexities inherent to the characterization and anticipation of illicit nuclear trafficking networks requires that a variety of modeling and knowledge technologies be jointly harnessed to construct an effective analytical and decision making workflow in which specific case studies can be built in reasonable time and with realistic effort. In this paper, we explore a solution to this challenge that integrates evidentiary and dynamic modeling with knowledge management and analytical gaming, and demonstrate its application to a geopolitical region at risk.

In this work, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) was employed in coagulation-flocculation process for the rapid treatment of polluted urban river water. And the organic pollutants removal by coagulation-flocculation process was investigated. The experimental results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was significantly affected by the coagulant dosage and the initial COD concentrations of polluted urban waters. The COD removal efficiencies increased steadily with the coagulant dosages increasing at first, then stabilized at the maximum levels (approximate 60-70%) when the dosages of PAC were about 0.55, 0.90, 1.20, 1.00 and 1.40mmol/L respectively. Quadratic regression models and a quick-search diagram of the three items (coagulant dosage, initial COD concentration and COD removal efficiency) were obtained by Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) 17.0. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that the quadratic regression models were significant, and the models fitted the experiment data well. The validity of quick-search diagram was confirmed by the additional experiments. The diagram was demonstrated as a reasonable and simple method to predict the economical coagulant dosages or the COD removal efficiency with different dosages in coagulation-flocculation process for polluted urban waters.

An Efficient Framework for Prediction in Healthcare Data Using Soft Computing Techniques	ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, PT III	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications	JUL 22-24, 2011	Kochi, INDIA			Imputation; soft computing; categorical data; continuous data		Healthcare organizations aim at deriving valuable insights employing data mining and soft computing techniques on the vast data stores that have been accumulated over the years. This data however, might consist of missing, incorrect and most of the time, incomplete instances that can have a detrimental effect on the predictive analytics of the healthcare data. Preprocessing of this data, specifically the imputation of missing values offers a challenge for reliable modeling. This work presents a novel preprocessing phase with missing value imputation for both numerical and categorical data. A hybrid combination of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Genetic Algorithms to impute missing continuous values and Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) to impute categorical values is adapted in this work. Further, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used to validate the improved accuracy of prediction after imputation. To evaluate this model, we use PIMA Indians Diabetes Data set (PIDD), and Mammographic Mass Data (MMD). The accuracy of the proposed model that emphasizes on a preprocessing phase is shown to be superior over the existing techniques. This approach is simple, easy to implement and practically reliable.

As a first step towards this goal, this paper describes an approach to leverage case history to predict outcomes at decision points in case-oriented semi-structured processes, and examine how the contents of documents at these decision points influence their outcomes. We apply an ant-colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm to create a probabilistic activity graph from traces, and use it to identify key decision points in a given process. For each activity node that represents a decision point in the mined probabilistic graph, the likelihood of different outcomes from the node can be correlated with the contents of documents accessed by the activity node. This is achieved by using a standard decision tree learning algorithm. We validate our approach on correlated case instance traces generated by a simulator that we constructed to implement non-deterministic executions of an automobile insurance claims scenario. In practice we find that our approach can lead to useful predictions at different; stages of execution in a semi-structured case oriented process.			gtlakshm@us.ibm.com; sduan@us.ibm.com; pkeyser@us.ibm.com; curbera@us.ibm.com; rkhalaf@us.ibm.com					Cook J.

J	Bruce, P				Bruce, Peter			TRAVELOGUE-A NEWCOMER ENCOUNTERS STATISTICS AND THE COMPUTER	JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Bootstrap; Decision trees; Microarrays; Permutation tests; Resampling		Computer-intensive methods have revolutionized statistics, giving rise to new areas of analysis and expertise in predictive analytics, image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, genomic analysis, and more. Interest naturally centers on the new capabilities the computer allows the analyst to bring to the table. This article, instead, focuses on the account of how computer-based resampling methods, with their relative simplicity and transparency, enticed one individual, untutored in statistics or mathematics, on a long journey into learning statistics, then teaching it, then starting an education institution.

J	Baecke, P; Van den Poel, D				Baecke, Philippe; Van den Poel, Dirk			IMPROVING PURCHASING BEHAVIOR PREDICTIONS BY DATA AUGMENTATION WITH SITUATIONAL VARIABLES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Customer relationship management (CRM); data enhancement; multilevel model; situational variables; purchase predictions; home vending; predictive analytics	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; ROC CURVE; SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; WEATHER; IMPLEMENTATION; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CHOICE	Nowadays, an increasing number of information technology tools are implemented in order to support decision making about marketing strategies and improve customer relationship management (CRM). Consequently, an improvement in CRM can be obtained by enhancing the databases on which these information technology tools are based. This study shows that data augmentation with situational variables of the purchase occasion can significantly improve purchasing behavior predictions for a home vending company. Three dimensions of situational variables are examined: physical surroundings, temporal perspective and social surroundings respectively represented by weather, time, and salesperson variables. The smallest, but still significant, increase in predictive performance was measured by enhancing the model with time variables. Besides the moment of the day, this study shows that the incorporation of weather variables, and more specifically sunshine, can also improve the accuracy of a CRM model. Finally, the best improvement in purchasing behavior predictions was obtained by taking the salesperson effect into account using a multilevel model.

This has led to a resurgence of interest in datalog, because of its powerful capability for processing complex rules, especially those involving recursion, and the exploitation of novel data structures that provide performance advantages over relational database systems. ORM 2 is a conceptual approach for fact oriented modeling that provides a high level graphical and textual syntax to facilitate validation of data models and complex rules with nontechnical domain experts. Datalog(LB) is an extended form of typed datalog that exploits fact-oriented data structures to provide deep and highly performant support for complex rules with guaranteed decidability. This paper provides an overview of recent research and development efforts to extend the Natural ORM Architect (NORMA) software tool to map ORM models to Datalog(LB).

When viewed in context of reliability centered maintenance programs, most industrial engines rely on one of the following systems: Time-based preventive maintenance analyses, Continuous monitoring systems that have first-principles deterministic models, or Run until failure operating philosophy Predictive analytics using empirically-derived pattern recognition algorithms can enhance problem detection and increase the effectiveness of an organization's monitoring program. With robust early detection that has few false alarms, equipment operators can remove time-dependent randomness from their ability to discover problems. Skilled equipment analysts and technicians will no longer spend time devoted to analyzing healthy equipment. When a company has numerous engine installations, scalability and cost-effectiveness becomes increasingly more important. Empirically-derived pattern recognition speeds fleet deployment across a wide range of equipment types and models. This reduces the dependence on the expertise that is required to establish and maintain a first-principles based system. Predictive analytics enables a bridge between the depth of coverage of a permanently installed full analytical system and the versatility of portable analyzers and preventive maintenance analyses. Equipment operators can use early detection from predictive analytics to focus their technicians on analyzing the right equipment at the right time. This paper will describe the predictive analytics modeling philosophy around frame mechanics, combustion, and emissions. One or more case studies will show the processes of even detection, diagnostics, collaboration, and information consolidation. The extension of predictive analytics is predictive diagnostics which combines detection with the context of how equipment operates. Equipment operators can extend run times and maintenance intervals by using predictive analytics as a foundation. The observations, diagnoses, and feedback will then roll up into a total asset management system and bridge major gaps that occur in many reliability programs. Predictive diagnostic methodologies enable equipment owners to extend run times and to decrease maintenance effort with confidence.

Mining and visualizing the chemical content of large databases	CURRENT OPINION IN DRUG DISCOVERY & DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						Drug discovery informatics; large chemical dataset; pharmacoinformatics; predictive analytics in chemical research; visualization of screening data	THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA; DRUG DISCOVERY; FRAGMENT DESCRIPTORS; HUMAN METABOLOME; LIGAND-BINDING; DATA SETS; DESIGN; FINGERPRINTS; TOOLS; MAPS	The shift in the drug discovery paradigm that has resulted in increased dependence on large volumes of information for decision making has created new challenges and opportunities in chemoinformatics research. The large volumes of data that are now available present an opportunity for the development of better predictive models, for the selection of more promising drug candidates, and for more comprehensive decisions to be made by researchers in chemistry and biology. The progress of this approach in drug discovery has also introduced challenges associated with the need to develop better tools to manage the large volumes of data. For chemistry-related research in particular, there is a need for more effective retrieval methods and better tools for data analysis that incorporate good interface design to facilitate the use of such systems by the non-expert scientist. This article reviews recent developments in the mining of large volumes of chemistry data, with a focus on chemoinformatics tools for small-molecule drug discovery and tools developed for analysis and in-depth mining. External sources of data, such as a variety of web services, further expand the volume of data to be analyzed during any small-molecule discovery project. The impact of the generation of large volumes of data and the related research factors is reshaping chemoinformatics work.

J	Nault, P; Halman, S; Paradis, J				Nault, Patrice; Halman, Samantha; Paradis, Josee			Ankle-Brachial Index on Kilimanjaro: Lessons from High Altitude	WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							ARTERIAL-DISEASE; EXERCISE; RESPONSES	Objective.-This study investigated the effects of a high-sympathetic stimulus environment (high-altitude hypoxia) on limb-specific systolic blood pressure (sBP) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) in normal volunteers. We hypothesized that currently accepted normal values for ABI may in fact not reflect an actual normal vascular state in all patients. Methods.-Twenty climbers (17 males, 3 females) from Gatineau-Hull (Quebec, Canada) participated in this study and ascended Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa. Ankle-brachial index measurements were performed at sea level and on Mount Kilimanjaro at similar to 4100 m. The data were analyzed using predictive analytics software SPSS 14.0. Data obtained at sea level were compared to those obtained at similar to 4100 m, with participants serving as their own controls. Results.-Ankle-brachial indices measured at similar to 4100 m (mean = 1.20) were greater than those measured at sea level (mean = 0.97) (n = -6.23; 95% CI: -.32 to -.17, P < .001). There were no significant differences between the systolic brachial pressures at similar to 4100 m when compared to those at sea level (P = .814). Contrarily, systolic ankle pressures at sea level (mean = 132) were significantly greater than those measured at similar to 4100 m (mean = 152) (t = -3.5, 95% CI: -29 to -7.4; P = .002). Conclusions.-This study is the first to physiologically demonstrate that in response to a high adrenergic stimulus in healthy volunteers there is a greater increase in sBP in the legs vs the arms.

J	Bose, R				Bose, Ranjit			Advanced analytics: opportunities and challenges	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data analysis; Competitive advantage		Purpose - Advanced analytics-driven data analyses allow enterprises to have a complete or "360 degrees" view of their operations and customers. The insight that they gain from such analyses is then used to direct, optimize, and automate their decision making to successfully achieve their organizational goals. Data, text, and web mining technologies are some of the key contributors to making advanced analytics possible. This paper aims to investigate these three mining technologies in terms of how they are used and the issues that are related to their effective implementation and management within the broader context of predictive or advanced analytics. Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published research literature on business intelligence (131); predictive analytics; and data, text and web mining is reviewed to explore their current state, issues and challenges learned from their practice. Findings - The findings are reported in two parts. The first part discusses a framework for 131 using the data, text, and web mining technologies for advanced analytics; and the second part identifies and discusses the opportunities and challenges the business managers dealing with these technologies face for gaining competitive advantages for their businesses. Originality/value - The Study findings are intended to assist business managers to effectively understand the issues and emerging technologies behind advanced analytics implementation.

This data, may consists of missing, incorrect and sometimes incomplete values sets that can have a detrimental effect on the decisions that are outcomes of data analytics. Using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, we have proposed an efficient imputation method using a hybrid combination of CART and Genetic Algorithm, as a preprocessing step. The classical neural network model is used for prediction, on the preprocessed dataset. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model far exceeds the existing models, mainly because of the soft computing preprocessing adopted. This approach is simple, easy to understand and implement and practical in its approach.	[Bhat, Veena H.; Rao, Prasanth G.; Shenoy, P. Deepa; Venugopal, K.

Optimizing water treatment systems using artificial intelligence based tools	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT V	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Sustainable Water Resources Management	SEP 09-11, 2009	MALTA	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		knowledge discovery from databases; data mining; decision trees; water quality; manganese; turbidity		Predictive modelling is a process used in predictive analytics to create a statistical model of future behaviour. Predictive analytics is the area of data mining concerned with forecasting probabilities and trends. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerns itself with intelligent behaviour, i.e. the things that make us seem intelligent. Following this process of thinking, in this work the main goal is the assessment of the impact of using AI based tools for the development of intelligent predictive models, in particular those that may be used to establish the conditions in which the levels of manganese and turbidity in water supply are high. Indeed, one of the main problems that the water treatment plant at Monte Novo (in Evora, Portugal) uncovers is the appearance of high levels of manganese and turbidity in treated water, which sometimes exceed the parametric values established in Portuguese Law, respectively 50 mu g dm(-3) and 4 NTU. In this study we tried to find answers to the above problem by building predictive models. The models we developed shall enable the prediction of manganese and turbidity levels in treated water, in order to ensure that the water supply does not affect public health in a negative way and obeys the current legislation. The software used in this study was the Clementine 11.1. The C5.0 Algorithm was also used as a means of introducing Decision Trees and the K-Means Algorithm was used to construct clustering models. The data in the database was collected from 2005 to 2006 and includes reservoir water quality data, treated water data and volumes of water stored in the reservoir.

Predictive analytics is the area of data mining concerned with forecasting probabilities and trends. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerns itself with intelligent behaviour, i.e. the things that make us seem intelligent. Following this process of thinking, in this work we have as the main goal the assessment of the impact of using AI based tools for the development of intelligent predictive models, in particular those that may be used to classify industrial waste, such as the residual waters in a refinery, based on the type of the mixtures of crude oil that arrive into the site to be processed. Indeed, these models will enable the prediction of the quality classes of the effluents that will be disposed, in order to assure that Industrial Residual Water does not affect negatively the ecology of the receptors or the Staff Health and Safety and obeys the current legislation. The software employed was Clementine 11.1 and C5.0 Algorithm was used to induce decisions trees. The data in the database was collected from 2006 to 2007, and includes production data and effluent analysis data.

Improvement in minority attack detection with skewness in network traffic	DATA MINING, INTRUSION DETECTION, INFORMATION ASSURANCE, AND DATA NETWORKS SECURITY 2008	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance and Data Networks Security 2008	MAR 17-18, 2008	Orlando, FL	SPIE		Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS); anomaly-based IDS; data-dependent fusion (DD fusion); false positive (FP); false negative (FN); precision; recall; F-score; detection performance; sensor fusion; neural network		The acceptability and usability of Intrusion Detection Systems get seriously affected with the data skewness in network traffic. A large number of false alarms mean a lot in terms of the acceptability of Intrusion Detection Systems. The reason for the increase in false alerts is that the normal traffic abound. Even with highly accurate Intrusion Detection Systems, the effective detection rate of the minority attack types will be unacceptably low and those attack types are often the most serious ones. Thus high accuracy is not necessarily an indicator of high model quality, and therein lies the accuracy paradox of predictive analytics. The cost of missing an attack is higher than the cost of false alarms. The lata-dependent sensor fusion architecture presented in this paper learns from the data and then appropriately gives weighting to the decisions of various Intrusion Detection Systems. The fusion enriches these weighted decisions to provide a single decision, which is better than those of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems. This method reduces the false positive rate and improves the overall detection rate and also the detection rate of minority class types in particular.

INTERSPEECH 2007: 8TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	Interspeech Conference 2007	AUG 27-31, 2007	Antwerp, BELGIUM			confidence prediction; predictive analytics		ASR confidence is a metric that reflects, to a large extent, the conditions under which a recognition task is being carried out as well as the reliability of the result. Because of this, ASR confidence constitutes a potentially useful feature in frameworks that attempt to asses the state of a dialog. In this paper we evaluate the predictability of ASR confidence based on knowledge of previously observed context-dependent confidences. We find out that the contextual confidence can be predicted with a standard prediction deviation less than 10% of the dynamic range of the confidence score, which represents a almost 40% relative reduction in standard deviation measure to a static confidence assumption baseline. Because our prediction is based on context, this predictability can be leveraged to produce an estimate of the expected average confidence until the end of a call based on the context path expected to be traversed.

It requires complex methodologies, including problem definition, data preparation, model selection, and model evaluation. This has limited the adoption of data mining at large and in the database and business intelligence (BI) communities more specifically. The concepts and methodologies used in data mining are foreign to database and BI users in general. This paper proposes a new approach to the design of data mining applications targeted at these user groups. This approach uses a data-centric focus and automated methodologies to make data mining accessible to nonexperts. The automated methodologies are exposed through high-level interfaces. This hides the data mining concepts away from the users thus helping to bridge the conceptual gap usually associated with data mining. We illustrate the approach with two applications: the new Oracle Predictive Analytics feature of Oracle Database 10g Release 2 and the Oracle Spreadsheet Add-In for Predictive Analytics.
