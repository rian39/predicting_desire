##TODO

1. check headings and subheadings map -- DONE
2. add a pointcloud for vectorisation
3. decide on the title - DONE
4. add a bit more on aggregates that are not people
5. add comment on why retail analytics has been so successful
6. discuss what happens as prediction is generalized

## Plan
1. vast spaces in cultural studies: the problem of studying these;  material actions; plots; problematization around accountability for going public; interventions in processes of individuation (human, non-human, and human-nonhuman) via new forms of aggregate;
2. fetishisation of algorithms -- whose fetish; 2 senses of these: if  algorithms become the social connective tissue, then they tend to become the object of attention; they take on a life of their own (cf 'her')
4. the practices of generalization -- how the techniques generalize;
5. the techniques of generalization -- what needs to happen so the techniques spread -- databases, pedagogy, implementation, services, narrowing down ... 
3. the processes of generalization -- how the techniques spread; but also how models generalize;

## Examples to use

- customer churn: plot
- BigInsight and Watson: plot
- Hadoop, R, scikit-learn; Weka;
- user-behaviour
- social interactions
- in-database analytics -- the epistemic is the material - problem
-  Who will do it? People or machines, and how will that be coordinate
-  The competition that shows a winner -- but only a pre-defined problem
-  What will happen? aggregates, suppression of individuation through performativity; 
-  The curve that shows improvement on a standard problem: optimization on model datasets
